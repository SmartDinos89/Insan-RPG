  dialogue:
  - 'Your Imperial Princes!! I''m gonna head for the capital now.

'
  - Remenber, if you want to get there too, you have to get throught the forest to
    the nearest city where a carige is waitin gto take you to the capital.
  - Also,
  - If you want to get throught the forest, I heard there might be something helpful
    in the cave to the WEST.
  - Apparently it was the hideout of some old adventurer, so you might find some
    good stuff in there.
